      "Building my portfolio was an exciting journey that combined learning, practice, and strong visual inspiration. I took design references from Ahmed Bousrih and Prashanth (Dribbble), whose work inspired me to pursue a clean, modern, and functional aesthetic. I used Next.js 14 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion — but more than the stack, I focused on creating something that truly reflects who I am as a developer.The goal was to fit meaningful content into a single screen, avoiding scrolling and keeping everything accessible at a glance. Soon, I’ll integrate my own notes API to bring real functionality into the project. This portfolio is more than a website — it marks my growth. A living project that will evolve with me.",
